The Akko 3068B Plus board has the separate click-on bezel, and the plate is slightly larger than the standard 3068

Per the generator, without padding, we get:
height 95.252mm
width 304.802mm


plate height:
97.50 mm

plate width:
    the case interior is exactly 12-1/8", pretty much.
    The plate is 12-1/8" minus maybe 0.75 mm of clearance

    Or
    between 307.975 mm
    and
    307.225 mm

    So
    Let's go for 307.20 mm


So we take the unpadded sizes and add

top:    1.12
bottom: 1.12

left:   1.2
right:  1.2

corner radius: 1 mm
